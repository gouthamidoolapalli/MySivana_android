<h4 class="h4.h41">How Invites Work</h4>

<p class="p.p1">The aim of this contest is to collect SIVA (MySivana) score. You collect SIVA points
    by transacting. What’s more, you can collect more every time your friends by inviting them to
    use the system.</p>
<ul>
    <li class="p.p1">This promotion ends when the count of users in the MySivana app reaches
        10,000
    </li>
    <li class="p.p1">Every time a new user signs up with your referral code and performs his first
        transaction, both you and the new user get 5 SIVA score. This is applicable only to the new
        user’s first transaction.
    </li>
    <li class="p.p1">For all subsequent transactions, only the user who initiated the transaction
        will receive 1 SIVA score for every 1000 rupees in the transaction.
    </li>
    <li class="p.p1">Fractions of 1000 rupees are ignored in assigning points. For example, if the
        user sends 14,500 rupees then the user will receive 14 points.
    </li>
    <li class="p.p1">When the promotion ends, the top 3 users with the highest SIVA score will be
        the winners. The first prize winner will receive 30 grams of gold, second prize winner
        receives 20 grams of gold and third prize winner will receive 10 grams of gold.
    </li>
    <li class="p.p1">In case of a tie in the SIVA score, the user who reached the SIVA score count
        first will be the winner for any of the top 3 positions
    </li>
