    <p class="p.p1"><span class="s1"><b></b></span><br></p>
    <li class="p.p1"></b><span
            class="s1"><b>MYSIVANA AS A PLATFORM<span
            class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></b></span></li>
    <p class="p.p1">MySivana offers an online platform through its website and/or mobile
        application,
        whereby users owing and holding digital assets may search and select merchants ( or Mysivana
        may
        act as a facilitator to search for appropriate Merchant for the users who wish to transfer
        or
        convert digital assets) who provide the service of exchange of digital assets to registered
        users, against their own money funds. The MySivana platform offers service purely as a
        facilitator of connecting the users (sender and receivers / beneficiary) and merchants
        (offeror
        of funds against receipt of compensation in digital assets) and limits to acting as a
        Platform
        only, to allow merchants who comply with MySivana’s policies to offer their service of
        making
        available money funds to the registered users of the MySivana platform who approach them for
        the
        same, against a compensation to be received by the registered users, through the MySivana
        Platform, in digital assets.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="p.p1">It is reiterated that neither MySivana nor any of its affiliates owns or makes
        available such funds or digital assets either to merchants or the registered users. The
        digital
        assets or the funds are legally and ostensibly owned by the registered users and merchants
        and
        any funds held by the MySivana Platform in online wallets or otherwise, in the name of
        registered users or the merchant, are only held as a lien on behalf of the registered users
        or
        the merchants. However owing to the dynamic nature of the business, the registered user and
        merchants whose online wallet balance are maintained by the MySivana Platform, any trading
        credits or interest income earned during the tenure of the holding of the funds or digital
        assets shall belong to the MySivana Platform exclusively. The merchant and user allow full
        and
        complete legal right to the MySivana Platform to trade digital assets or earn interest on
        their
        funds or digital assets, however subject to limitation of non-erosion of the principle
        capital (
        signifying the digital asset originally earned by the Merchant as a compensation against the
        money fund paid to the registered user or the digital assets held by registered users for
        the
        purpose of conversion to money funds) held by them.</p>
    <p class="p.p1">Again, MySivana is not directly involved in the transaction between registerd
        user
        and merchant. As a result, MySivana has no control over the quality, safety, morality or
        legality of any aspect of the digital asset or funds transacted, however industry best
        standards
        of security and compliance as are reasonable, by the management of the company, to ensure
        efficient and seamless transactions between the registered user and the merchant be ensured
        by
        the MySivana Platform. The merchant is expected to maintain highest level of self accuracy
        and
        put in place standards of check and audit, which it shall deem fit, for efficient
        transactions
        of digital assets with registered users whose validation of identity shall be the sole
        responsibility of the merchant; though MySivana Platform may at the time of registration of
        users, ensure that the recipient or beneficiary of funds is a bonafide entity and efforts
        shall
        be made to ensure that the very same person who has been identified by the sender of funds,
        as
        the true and correct recipient actually be the beneficiary of funds. In such a case, the
        Merchant is expected to perform adequate due diligence at the time of remittance or hand
        over of
        money funds against the receipt of digital assets, to the registerd user. Any anomaly in the
        transaction shall solely be the liability of the merchant and the MySivana Platform is
        neither
        the forum nor the platform to act as an indemnifier or conciliator or arbitrator in case of
        mismanagement of funds or loss of digital asset, whatsoever, for the transactions between
        merchant and the registered user.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="p.p1">MySivana does not statutorily ensure the ability of merchants to make available
        funds as claimed by the merchants on the Platform; however as a service the MySivana
        Platform
        may ensure to inform the registered user, through its app or website, of the available
        merchants<span
                class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp; </span>who claim to hold funds at the time when
        the
        request for funds is put in, by the registered users. Though the actual availability of
        funds at
        any given time, shall be the sole responsibility of the merchant, who also has to ensure the
        bonafide source of such funds, including the legal ownership of the same by the
        merchant.<span
                class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="p.p1">The registered user may also exercise reasonable caution and perform its own due
        diligence on the merchant if it so require with or without pre information to the merchant
        or
        the platform, as a customary right available to the registered user under general law for
        the
        time being in force.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="p.p1">Again, the MySivana platform does not provide any special right to the
        registered
        user to perform test or audit on the merchant, however as a person of reasonable prudence
        who
        may so require, perform such tests to its satisfaction, in such a case the merchant should
        be
        free &amp; open to such checks, however the merchant may inform the MySivana Platform about
        the
        same through an intimation in writing and any assistance in this exercise may be granted by
        the
        MySivana Platform to ensure integrity of the merchant, at the Company’s own discretion.</p>
    <p class="p.p1">MySivana Platform cannot ensure that a registered user or merchant will actually
        complete a transaction. Consequently, MySivana does not have right or ability to transfer
        legal
        ownership of traded funds or digital assets from / to the merchant and the registered user.
        MySivana cannot legally guarantee the true identity, age, and nationality of a merchant or a
        registered user, since its services are limited to making available the environment for the
        transaction and not performance of the transaction, per se. <span
                class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="p.p1">Being a transaction enabler only without control over execution of transactions,
        MySivana Platform allows registered users to communicate directly with potential transaction
        partners, being merchants, through the tools available on the Site. The merchants are
        expected
        to honour the claims and commitments made on the platform, and to execute bonafide
        transactions
        with the registered users of the platform against the compensation being received in digital
        asset.</p>
    <p class="p.p1">You agree that MySivana is a Platform and as such is not responsible or liable
        for
        any claims or commitments posted by you, registered users, other merchants, or outside
        parties
        on MySivana Platform. <span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p>
